Question: Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

Answer: A deep inheritance tree make the testing become complex. Subclasses depend on the super classes. When there are modification in the super class, all the test for the sub classes should be updated. For controllability, we'll have to controll every super class of sub classes, and it will be very complicated for a deep inheritance tree. For observability, we will have to observe a large number of sub classes if we have a deep inheritance tree.
