Question: Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2 , also on P.

(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
(c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

Answer:
(a): Yes. Because C1 subsumes C2.
(b): No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.
(c): No. Test set T2 is not needed to be a subset of test set T1. So if T2 contains a test that reveal the fault, T1 does not guarantee to have the same test.
