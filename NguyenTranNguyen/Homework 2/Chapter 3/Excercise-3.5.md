Question: The following JUnit test method for the sort() method has a nonsyntactic flaw. Find the flaw and describe it in terms of the RIPR model. Be as precise, specific, and concise as you can. For full credit, you must use the terminology introduced in the book. In the test method, names is an instance of an object that stores
strings and has methods add(), sort(), and getFirst(), which do exactly what you would expect from their names. You can assume that the object names has been properly instantiated and the add() and sort() methods have already been tested and work correctly

Answer: The assertion only check if Alex is the first element of the list. If any of the name can not be added or if the sorting causes the loose of some name or other names are not in positions, this assertion can not reveal the failure. The test needs to check the order of the entire list.
