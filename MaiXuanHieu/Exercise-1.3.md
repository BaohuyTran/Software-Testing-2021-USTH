Level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk means at level 3 the main goal is to reduce/minimize the number of possible failure could happen because not only the software could have error and fault but there may also happen problems when our machines run the software. So that why you want to reduce/minimize as many posibilities of a failure occured as posible. That is the risk we are talking about, and we can't reduce it to zero because simply there is no way to do that in practical since risk always there no matter how small or how big it or its consequences are.
