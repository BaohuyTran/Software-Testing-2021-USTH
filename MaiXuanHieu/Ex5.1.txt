a) The answer is yes, because coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.
b) The answer is no, because T2 satisfies C2 and C2 is the subsumtion (the smaller version) of C1.
c) The situation here is T2 reveals the fault in P but T1 does necessarily also reveal it. We have the following posibilies:
- T2 may have the specific design/test to reveal the fault and T1 simply doesn't.
- The test set in T2 is not even the subset of the test set in T1.
