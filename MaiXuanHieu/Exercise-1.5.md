Ex1.5

1) Find last index of element
	
a) The program will not check the first value in the array because the condition for loop is wrong.

Modification:

	for(int i = x.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
	
b) Test case:

	test : x = null, y = 2
	
Because x is null the program will execute NullPointerException right off the bat.

c) Test case:

	test : x = [2, 3, 5]; y = 3; Expected = 1
	
Not result in an error state because 3 is in index 1 of the array.

d) Test case:

	test : x = [2, 3, 5]; y = 4; Expected = -1
	
Result in an error, but not a failure because 4 is not in the array.

e) Test case:

	x = [2, 3, 5]; y = 2; Expected = 0 
	
Actual = -1

Complete state is after the execute of count but right before return -1;
