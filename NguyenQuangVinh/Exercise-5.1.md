## Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

#### (a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
    Yes, T1 satisfy C2 because C2 is the subsumtion of C1

#### (b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
    No, T2 does not necessarily satisfy C1 because T2 only follow the C2 the subsumtion of C1

#### (c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.
    Because T2 maybe design specially for that fault and T1 is for general
