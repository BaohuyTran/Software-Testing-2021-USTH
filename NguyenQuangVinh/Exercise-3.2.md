## Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

Controllability: How easy it is to provide a program with the needed inputs, in terms of values, operations, and behaviors. 
=> So, the test case may contain many different classes that is hard the tract.

Software Observability: How easy it is to observe the behavior of a program in terms of its outputs, effects on the environment, and other hardware and software components. 
=> So, to observe the behavior of the program we need to look through many many classes for their methods.
