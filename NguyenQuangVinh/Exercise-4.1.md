## Calc currently implements one function: it adds two integers. Use test-driven design to add additional functionality to subtract two integers, multiply two integers, and divide two integers. First create a failing test for one of the new functionalities, modify the class until the test passes, then perform any refactoring needed. Repeat until all of the required functionality has been added to your new version of Calc, and all tests pass.
