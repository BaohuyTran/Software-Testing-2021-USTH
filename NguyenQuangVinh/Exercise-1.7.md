## Consider the following three example classes. These are OO faults taken from Joshua Bloch’s Effective Java, Second Edition. Answer the following questions about each

#### (a) Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.

#### (b) If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.

#### (c) If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.

#### (d) If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter.

#### (e) In the given code, describe the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state.

#### (f) Implement your repair and verify that the given test now produces the expected output. Submit a screen printout or other evidence that your new program works
