Exercise-1.3 : What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero
    Level 3 of Beizer's testing levels basically is to make software risk-free. 
    In this phase :
        - Tester and developer work as a team 
        - When fault identifies considered as benefical rather than non-existent
        - Software becomes able to remove some bugs
        - Both the person work towards a common goal to reduce risk to software usability
    Risk :
    Risk can be defined as the possibility of any kind of loss that leads to the project failure. In this process, we reduce all kinds of risks that affect the software development life cycle. Risk management plays a very important role in dealing with risk
    Type of risk :
        - Financial risk
        - Business risk
        - Project risk 
    Advantages of risk management :
        - Ensures that the system is safe from failures
        - Risk reduction
        - Risk identification and correction
        - Provides a way to handle the risk
        - Provides software security from all kinds od losses
        - Reduces all kind of impacts that can lead to project failure
