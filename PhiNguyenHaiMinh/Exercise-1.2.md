Exercise-1.2 : What is the differnce between software fault and software failure?
    Software failure occurs when the software does not do what the user expects to see.     Software fault, on the other hand, is a hidden programming error.
    A software fault becomes a software failure only when the exacr computation conditions are met, and the faulty portion of the code is executed on the CPU. 
        This can occur during :
            - Normal usage
            - When the software is ported to a different hardware platform
            - When the software is ported to a different complier
            - When the software gets extended
