Exercise-3.2: Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritancehierarchy can affect controllability and observability.
    Inheritance hierarchy can complicate the process of the testing objects and hence impacts the contrallability as well as observability. The correct behavior os the system gets affected by the inheritance.
    The controllability, as well as observability, happens to be a factor of the reusability and maintainability/
    The variables get affected by the control inputs and hence the controllability gets affected by the inheritance process
