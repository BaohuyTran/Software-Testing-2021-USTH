What is the difference between software fault and software failure ?
When software fails to do what the consumer expects, it is referred to as software failure. A software failure, on the other hand, is a programming error that is not visible.
When the same calculation conditions are met and the faulty portion of the code is executed on the CPU, a software error becomes a software fault.
