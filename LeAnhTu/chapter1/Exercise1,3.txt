Chapter 1


Exercise 1.1: What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Bezier’s testing level 2
(testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?
Answers:
    - Anticipate and predict possibilities: the more prepared the software,the more likely it is to have a coherent
structure to produce better quality.
    - Good architecture and design: a consistent architecture and principles create a solid foundation for software
that reduces effort, time, and money.
    - Defect measurement: use the software as if it were your customer! Build software reports, you can spot
errors and use that information to quickly fix them!
    - Good unit tests: the main outputs, inputs, and tools are key. This gives testers more time and power.


Exercise 1.3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk?
Can we reduce the risk to zero?
Answer:
    - The possibility of loss is also known as risk. We cannot completely control the risk this means that the
purpose of testing is to reduce the risk but testing is still essential to help detect and suppress bugs not only in
the development stages but also throughout the product life cycle.
