!Question: what factor would help a development organization
move from Beizer's testing level 2 to 4?

!Answer:
*** To help a development organization move from
Beizer's testing level 2 to testing level 4, we divide
the process into 2 smaller processes:

1. From Level 2 to Level 3: the organization starts with realization
that testing can show the presence of failures, and accepts that there
exists some risk whenever the software is used. Therefore, the entire
team (both testers and developers) has to work together to reduce risk

2. From level 3 to Level 4: the organization has to defines testing
as a mental discipline that increase quality. Adopting this mindset,
test engineers can become the technical leaders of the project and have
the primary responsibility for the improvement of software quality.
