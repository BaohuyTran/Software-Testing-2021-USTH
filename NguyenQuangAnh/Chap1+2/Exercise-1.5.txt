!Question: Given the 4 faulty programs. Answer questions

!Answer:
*** Find last Element
a. Does not check the first index of array.
    Modification: for (int i=x.length-1; i>-1; i--)
b. test: x = [1, 2, 3], y = 2; Expect = 1
c, d, e. There will be no error state.

*** Find last index Zero
a. Check for the first index of zero instead of the last.
    Modification: for (int i=x.length-1; i > -1; i--)
b. test: x = [1, 1, 0]; Expect = 2
c, d, e. There will be no error state.

*** Count positive elements
a. The method does not static.
        Modification: public static int countPositive(int[] x)
   The condition takes 0 as a positive values
        Modification: if (x[i] > 0)
b, c, d. There will always be an error.
e. The error is: non-static method countPositive(int[])
After fixing the non-static method
b. test: x = [1, 2, -1, 2]; Expect = 3

*** Conut odd or positive elements
a. The % cannot apply for minus values
        Modification: if (Math.abs(x[i])%2 == 1 || x[i] > 0)
b. test x = [0, 1, 2, 4, -2]; Expect = 3
c, d, e. There will be no error state
