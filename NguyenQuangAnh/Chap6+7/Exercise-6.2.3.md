*__Question:__ Write down all 16 tests to satisfy the Multiple Base Choice Coverage (MBCC) for the second categorization of triang()’s inputs.*

*__Answer:__*

We choose both '1' and '2' base choices for side 1.<br>
Then we have 2 base tests: (1, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 2). <br>
There will be 16 different tests:

*(1, 2, 2), (1, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2), (1, −1, 2), <br>
(1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, −1), (2, 2, 2),<br>
(0, 2, 2), (−1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (2, 0, 2), <br>
(2, −1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, −1)<br>*
