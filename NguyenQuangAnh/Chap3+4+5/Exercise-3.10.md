*__Question:__ Replace each occurrence of a set with a list in the JUnit theory *__removeThenAddDoesNotChangeSet__*. Is the resulting theory valid or invalid? How many of the tests that pass the precondition also pass the postcondition? Explain.*

*__Answer:__*
In the resulting theory, order does matter in list.
Therefore, the theory will be definitely not valid, and due to that the JUnit theory will fail.
