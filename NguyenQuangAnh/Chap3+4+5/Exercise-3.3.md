*__Question:__ Develop JUnit tests for the BoundedQueue class. Make sure your tests check every method, but we will not evaluate the quality of your test designs and do not expect you to satisfy any test criteria. Turn in a printout of your JUnit tests and either a printout or a screen shot showing the results of each test.*

*__Answer:__* Check the *BoundedQueueTest.java* file.
