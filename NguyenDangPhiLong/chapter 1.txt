Ex 1.1:
Some factors that helps a development organizations move from Beizer's testing level 2 to testing level 4:
- Good communication, good realationship between developers and testers.
- Realization of testing will show appearence of failures not their absence.
- Upgrade the tests become things that cause programs fail. 

Ex 1.3:
- "Risk" means the possibility of failure appearence belongs to a program
- To reduce it by zero depends on the program we work it, as large as the program is, as difficult as to reduce the "risk" by zero

Ex 1.4:
a)
import java.util.Vector;

class Vector { 
	public static Vector union(Vector a, Vector b) { 
		Vector v = new Vector(); 
		v.addAll(a); 
		v.addAll(b); 
		return v; 
	} 
	public static void main(String[] arg) { 
		Vector a = new Vector(); 
		a.add(9); 
		Vector b = new Vector(); 
		b.add(5); 
		Vector v = union(a, b); 
	} 
} 
b) There has no verification statement to check whether two vectors are empty
c)
Test case [1]
Vector a = new Vector()
Vector b = new Vector()
-------------
Test case [2]
Vector a = new Vector();
a.add(9)
Vector b = new Vector();
--------------
Test case [3]
Vector a = new Vector();
Vector b = new Vector();
b.add(5)
d)
public static Vector union(Vector a, Vector b, boolean inv = False)
{
  if (a.isEmpty() && b.isEmpty()) return Null;
  else
  {
    if (inv)
    {
      Vector c = new Vector();
      c.addAll(b);
      c.addAll(a);
      return c;
    }
    else
    {
      Vector c = new Vector();
      c.addAll(a);
      c.addAll(b);
      return c;
    }
